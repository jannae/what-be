#What? Be.
##Final Project for RWET, 2013.05.08


###Introduction

Knowing that this assignment was to ultimately be a performance piece, I leaned slightly more towards a theatrical script-style format than poetry, though dialogue can be poetry too. 

This is an exercise in attempting to create a terse, Beckett- or Mamet- style dialogue through a computer. The first line would be inqusitive, the second line obnoxious, the third line then repetitive and annoyed, yet with more detail. This piece is semi-context-aware, based on parts-of-speech and sentence strucutre, and randomness comes in the form of phrase pairings. The project utilizes the [NLTK library](http://nltk.org/), with the [Brown Corpus](http://icame.uib.no/brown/bcm.html) for part of speech identification and phrase placement.

####Dialogue format:

> Question phrase + chain based on typically related tags to the phrase + ?  
> Obnoxious repitition of the final word + pronoun-based "being" phrase. Repeat Q?
> Repeat Question phrase predicate. Verb phrase + chain based phrase + final piece of original question + prepositional phrase to close sentence ...

	is filled. still refused to their more loudly, banging more to the daintylegged...
